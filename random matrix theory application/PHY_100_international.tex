% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepac_jage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
A communication network is considered that consists of a transmitter, a legitimate receiver, an eavesdropper and several friendly helpers. The transmitter and the helpers are equipped with multiple antennas while the legitimate receiver or the eavesdropper has one antenna. The transmitter and the helpers have the channel state information (CSI) to the legitimate receiver. The channels to the eavesdropper are partially known and modeled with uncertainty ellipsoids. The transmitter applies maximum ratio transmission to the legitimate receiver. The helpers generate interference to degrade the receiving performance of the eavesdropper. The transmit power of the helpers is optimized with the worst-case secrecy rate requirement as the QoS constraint. Based on robust convex optimization, a centralized optimization problem is developed for the helpers to transmit noise efficiently with minimum total transmit power. A distributed algorithm is developed which scales well with a large number of helpers.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
In wireless communication, security is a major concern. Traditionally, the security issue is addressed in upper layers. But secret key management is a challenge because of the broadcast nature of wireless communication \cite{liang2009information}. Besides cryptography, physical layer security can improve the security of wireless communication. Wyner first investigated the wiretap channel which involves a transmitter, a legitimate receiver and an eavesdropper \cite{wyner1975wire}. The upper bound of all achievable secrecy rates with which the transmitter sends the private messages to the legitimate receiver while keeping the eavesdropper from decoding them is defined as the secrecy capacity. Following Wyner's work, secrecy capacities of many kinds of channels were studied\cite{leung1978gaussian,liang2008secure,tekin2008general}. 

Because of the additional degree of freedom provided by the multi-antenna systems, artificial noise has been widely studied as a way to degrade the performance of the eavesdropper and improve the secrecy rate. Many researchers have investigated the case where the transmitter allocates part of the transmit power to send artificial noise and optimizes the power allocation. Chae~\emph{et~al.} assumed there is a secrecy protected zone. The additional secrecy enhancement is realized using artificial noise and optimal power allocation between the information-bearing signal and the artificial noise was derived \cite{chae2014enhanced}. Lin \emph{et al.} assumed perfect legitimate channel state information (CSI), and the statistics of the eavesdropper's channel are known. A generalized method allowing injecting the artificial noise to the legitimate channel was proposed \cite{lin2013secrecy}.


The cooperation among transmitting nodes to improve the secrecy rate has also been investigated. Cooperative jamming (CJ) is proposed, where friendly nodes generate interference to ``jam" the eavesdropper specifically~\cite{tekin2008general,lai2008relay,li2011cooperative,wolf_zero_2010,pei_adaptive_2014,yang_optimal_2013,ding_opportunistic_2011,park_jamming_2013}. Tekin~\emph{et al.} proposed a method to improve the achievable secrecy sum-rate for general Gaussian multiple access and two-way relay wiretap channels\cite{tekin2008general}. The relay nodes can work in cooperative jamming mode, in which the relay nodes send codewords independent of the source message to confuse the eavesdropper\cite{lai2008relay,li2011cooperative}. Wolf~\emph{et al.} investigated the multiple input single output (MISO) wiretap channel with a helper and analyzed the optimality of zero-forcing beamforming strategy~\cite{wolf_zero_2010}. Yang~\emph{et al.} investigated CJ for multiuser multiple input multiple output (MIMO) broadcast channels to enhance the physical layer security with the help of a friendly jammer. The base station sends multiple independent data streams to multiple legitimate receivers. During the transmission, there are multiple eavesdroppers with multiple antennas that are interested in the streams from the base station \cite{yang_optimal_2013}. In practice, only partial CSI can be got especially for eavesdropper's CSI (ECSI). Huang~\emph{et al.} studied CJ with only one helper with imperfect ECSI in MISO wiretap channels \cite{huang_robust_2012}. Zhang~\emph{et al.} investigated CJ aided robust secure transmission design, where a cooperative jammer introduces jamming interference and assists a source to supply wireless power for both an energy receiver and a legitimate destination\cite{Zhang_Cooperative2015}. Luo~\emph{et al.} studied the case where there are multiple multi-antenna helpers that transmit noise to confound the eavesdropper. The statistics of the eavesdropper's channel is assumed\cite{luo_uncoordinated_2013}.

In this paper, we consider the robust secure communication problem with cooperative jamming. Different from other literature, we put emphasis on the case where there are many friendly helpers. Several helpers are deployed to guarantee the secrecy between the transmitter and the legitimate receiver. These helpers only generate noise to assist the transmitter and the legitimate receiver to guarantee the worst-case secrecy rate. We assume that the channels toward the eavesdropper are not perfectly known. The uncertainties of the eavesdropper's channels are described with an ellipsoid model. With the worst-case secrecy rate as the QoS constraint, the transmit power of the helpers is optimized. More helpers can effectively confuse the eavesdropper compared with the approach of artificial noise generated by the transmitter or one helper. The trade-off is the coordination requirement of the helpers. We develop distributed algorithm with moderate signaling among the helpers to reduce the coordination.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.  The system model is described in Section II.  In Section III, the uncertainties of the eavesdropper's channels are described and an algorithm for optimal helper transmission is proposed based on robust convex optimization.  In Section IV, a distributed algorithm is further developed in order to reduce implementation complexity.  Numerical results are given in Section V and conclusions are drawn in Section VI.

\section{System Model} \label{sec:system model}
Consider a network composed of a transmitter, a receiver, an eavesdropper and several helpers. The intended transmitter is called Alice; the legitimate receiver is called Bob; the eavesdropper is called Eve. A secure communication scenario is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:system}. Alice wants to send private messages to Bob. In order to aid the secure communication from Alice to Bob, the $N$ helpers generate interference to degrade the receiving performance of Eve.  Alice and each helper are equipped with $M$ antennas. The channel from Alice to Bob $\mathbf{h}_0 \in \mathbb{C}^{M \times 1}$, and the channels from the helpers to Bob $\mathbf{h}_i \in \mathbb{C}^{M \times 1}, i = 1,\ldots,N$ are known.
\begin{figure}[!tb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=8.7cm]{system.png} % requires the graphicx package
	\caption{Communication scenario.}
	\label{fig:system}
\end{figure}
Assuming Alice uses a fixed beamforming strategy, the received signal of Bob $y_b$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
y_b =\mathbf{h}_{0}^{H}\mathbf{w}_0 x_0 + \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbf{h}_{i}^H\mathbf{x}_{i} + n,
\end{eqnarray}
where $x_0$ is the message transmitted from Alice, and $\mathbf{E}\{|x_0|^2\} = 1$; $\mathbf{E}\{\cdot\}$ means expectation; $[\cdot]^H$ denotes Hermitian operation. $\mathbf{w}_{0} \in \mathbb{C}^{M \times 1}$  is the beamforming vector of Alice, which satisfies the transmit power constraint $\|\mathbf{w}_0\|_2^2 \leq P_0$. $n \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_n^2)$ is complex noise. $\mathbf{x}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{Q}_i)$ is the signal transmitted from Helper-$i$. Hermitian positive semi-definite  matrix $\mathbf{Q}_i \succeq 0$ is the covariance matrix of signal $\mathbf
{x}_i$. The transmit power constraint of Helper-$i$ is 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{E}\{\|\mathbf{x}_i\|_2^2\}  = \mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{E}\{\mathbf{x}_i\mathbf{x}_i^H\} )= \mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i) \leq P_i.
\end{eqnarray}
The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of Bob is
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:SINR of Bob}
\mathrm{SINR}_b = \frac{\left| \mathbf{h}_{0}^H\mathbf{w}_{0}\right|^2}{\sigma_n^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{h}_{i}^H\mathbf{Q}_{i}\mathbf{h}_i}.
\end{eqnarray}

The received signal of Eve $y_e$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
y_e = \mathbf{g}_0^H\mathbf{w}_0x_0 + \sum_{i = 1}^N\mathbf{g}_i^H\mathbf{x}_i + m,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathbf{g}_0 \in \mathbb{C}^{M \times 1}$ is the channel vector from Alice to Eve; $\mathbf{g}_i \in \mathbb{C}^{M \times 1}$ is the channel vector from Helper-$i$ to Eve.   Assume $m$ is complex Gaussian such that $m \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_m^2)$.
The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the eavesdropper is
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{SINR}_e &=& \frac{\left| \mathbf{g}_{0}^H\mathbf{w}_{0}\right|^2}{\sigma_m^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{g}_{i}^H\mathbf{Q}_{i}\mathbf{g}_i} \label{eq:secure_capacity}.
\end{eqnarray}

The achievable secrecy rate of Bob is given by \cite{6728676}
\begin{equation}
R_s = \log_2\left(1 + \mathrm{SINR}_b\right)-\log_2\left(1 + \mathrm{SINR}_e\right).
\end{equation}


\section{Robust Convex Optimization of Secure Communication} \label{sec:robust programming}
%When the eavesdropper is active \cite{gopala2008secrecy,feng_miso}, Alice and the helpers can determine the channels. When the eavesdropper is passive, the channels can be estimated through the local oscillator power inadvertently leaked from the eavesdropper's receiver radio frequency frontend \cite{mukherjee2012detecting,feng_miso}.
The methods in \cite{li_optimal_2011} addresses the optimal transmit design for MISO wiretap channel without friendly helpers. The non-convex problem is approximated to a convex optimization problem. The scenario where only imperfect CSI is available is considered. The methods in \cite{Zhang_Cooperative2015,huang_cooperative_2011} deal with the robust transmission design for MISO wiretap channel with only one helper aiding the secure transmission. However, normally the channel to the eavesdropper is hard to estimate. When the channel errors are too large, the worst-case secrecy rate is small when there is only one  helper or no jammers. In such scenario, more helpers can cooperatively generate enough interference to guarantee the worst-case secrecy rate.
\subsection{Channel Uncertainty} 
Like \cite{huang_cooperative_2011}, the channels to the eavesdropper are partially known. We assume that  Alice and the helpers have imperfect estimated eavesdropper's channels $\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i$. The channel error vectors are defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i = \mathbf{g}_i-\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i,\forall i = 0,\ldots, N.
\end{eqnarray}
We assume that the channel errors lie in the bounded sets $\mathcal{G}_i=\{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i: \tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i^H \mathbf{R}_i\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i \leq 1\}, \forall i = 0,\cdots,N$. Hermitian positive definite  $\mathbf{R}_i  \succ \mathbf{0}$ determines the variation of channel $\mathbf{g}_i$. 

\subsection{Transmit Strategy of Alice}
The basic idea of the transmit strategy of the system is to let Alice maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of Bob, and leave the job of guaranteeing the secure communication to the helpers by generating enough noise to Eve. Assuming the helpers adopt zero forcing (ZF) method to transmit noise to Eve and eliminate interference to Bob,
the ZF constraints can be expressed as
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:ZF constraint}
\mathbf{h}_i^H\mathbf{Q}_i \mathbf{h}_i = 0, \forall i = 1,\ldots,N \label{eq:ZF_constraint_relaxed}.
\end{eqnarray}
From \eqref{eq:SINR of Bob} and \eqref{eq:ZF constraint}, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of Bob is 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{SINR}_b= \frac{\left| \mathbf{h}_{0}^H\mathbf{w}_{0}\right|^2}{\sigma_n^2 }. 
\end{eqnarray}
%$\mathrm{SINR}_b$ is not dependent on the transmit covariance matrices of the helpers. 
The optimal strategy maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of Alice is maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and the corresponding beamforming vector follows as
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{w}_0 = \sqrt{P_0}\frac{\mathbf{h}_0}{\|\mathbf{h}_0\|_2} \label{eq:optimal_w}.
\end{eqnarray}
%The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of Bob is
%\begin{eqnarray} 
%\mathrm{SINR}_b= \frac{P_0\| \mathbf{h}_{0}\|_2^2}{\sigma_n^2 }.  \label{eq:SINR_b}
%\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Transmit Strategies of the Helpers}
The signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of Eve can be bounded as
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{SINR}_e & < & \frac{\left| \mathbf{g}_{0}^H\mathbf{w}_{0}\right|^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{g}_{i}^H\mathbf{Q}_{i}\mathbf{g}_i} \label{eq:neglect_sigma}\\
%&=& \frac{\left|\bar{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{w_0} + \tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{w}_0\right|^2}{\sum_{i = 1}^N(\bar{\mathbf{g}}+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\mathbf{Q}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)}\\
&\leq & \frac{\left|\bar{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{w_0}\right|^2 + \left|\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{w}_0\right|^2}{\sum_{i = 1}^N(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\mathbf{Q}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)}\\
%&\leq & \frac{\left|\bar{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{w_0}\right|^2 + \tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{w}_0\mathbf{w}_0^H\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0}{\sum_{i = 1}^N(\bar{\mathbf{g}}+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\mathbf{Q}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)}\\
& \leq & \frac{\left|\bar{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{w_0}\right|^2 + \max_{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0 \in \mathcal{G}_0}(\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{w}_0\mathbf{w}_0^H\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0)}{\min_{\{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i \in \mathcal{G}_i\}}\sum_{i = 1}^N(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\mathbf{Q}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)} .
\label{eq:SINR_e}
\end{eqnarray}
In \eqref{eq:neglect_sigma}, the noise is removed. This is because we consider the case where Eve has the best possible receiving performance. 
We want to constrain the maximum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of Eve to a limit, which means
\begin{equation} \label{eq:SINR_constraint}
\frac{\left|\bar{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{w_0}\right|^2 + \max_{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0 \in \mathcal{G}_0}(\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{w}_0\mathbf{w}_0^H\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0)}{\min_{\{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i \in \mathcal{G}_i\}}\sum_{i = 1}^N(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\mathbf{Q}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)} \leq \gamma.
\end{equation}
 %That is 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\max \mathrm{SINR}_e \leq \gamma \label{eq:SINR_constraint},
%\end{eqnarray} 
%where $\gamma$ is the limit. 

Then the achievable secrecy rate can be guaranteed as
\begin{eqnarray}
R_s \geq \log_2\left(1 + P_0\|\mathbf{h}_0\|_2^2/\sigma_n^2\right) - \log_2\left(1 + \gamma\right). \label{eq:secure_capacity1}
\end{eqnarray}
Given the requirement of secrecy rate $R_s$, the predefined limit $\gamma$ can be determined from \eqref{eq:secure_capacity1}.

In order to guarantee $\mathrm{SINR}_e$ to be within the predetermined limit $\gamma$, the maximum numerator of fraction \eqref{eq:SINR_e} is calculated first by substituting \eqref{eq:optimal_w} into \eqref{eq:SINR_e}. We obtain
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} \label{eq:numerator problem}
& \underset{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_{0}}{\text{maximize}}
& & \frac{P_0}{\|\mathbf{h}_0\|_2^2}|\bar{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{h}_0|^2 +\frac{P_0}{\|\mathbf{h}_0\|_2^2} \tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{h}_0\mathbf{h}_0^H\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0 \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{R}_0\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0 \leq 1.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Let $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}(\mathbf{R})$ be the largest eigenvalue of $\mathbf{R}$, then
\begin{eqnarray}
\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}(\mathbf{R})= \max_{\mathbf{y}^H\mathbf{y} \leq 1} \mathbf{y}^H\mathbf{R}\mathbf{y}. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
If we define $\mathbf{R}_0^{1/2}\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_0 = \hat{\mathbf{g}}_0$, problem \eqref{eq:numerator problem} is transformed to the following problem
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} \label{eq:numerator problem1}
& \underset{\hat{\mathbf{g}}_{0}}{\text{maximize}}
& & \frac{P_0}{\|\mathbf{h}_0\|_2^2}|\bar{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{h}_0|^2 +\frac{P_0}{\|\mathbf{h}_0\|_2^2} \hat{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{R}_0^{-1/2}\mathbf{h}_0\mathbf{h}_0^H\mathbf{R}_0^{-1/2}\hat{\mathbf{g}}_0 \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \hat{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\hat{\mathbf{g}}_0 \leq 1.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Then the optimal value of problem \eqref{eq:numerator problem1} is
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\frac{P_0}{\|\mathbf{h}_0\|_2^2}\left(|\bar{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{h}_0|^2 + \lambda_{\mathrm{max}}(\mathbf{R}_0^{-1/2}\mathbf{h}_0\mathbf{h}_0^H\mathbf{R}_0^{-1/2})\right) \nonumber\\
&=&\frac{P_0}{\|\mathbf{h}_0\|_2^2}\left(|\bar{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{h}_0|^2 + \|\mathbf{R}_0^{-1/2}\mathbf{h}_0\|_2^2\right)\label{eq:eigen_norm},
\end{eqnarray} 
where \eqref{eq:eigen_norm} follows from the fact that the rank of $\mathbf{R}_0^{-1/2}\mathbf{h}_0$ is 1. Then the constraint of limiting $\mathrm{SINR}_e$ \eqref{eq:SINR_constraint}  becomes
\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:sum_noise}
\min_{\{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i \in \mathcal{G}_i\}}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\mathbf{Q}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i) \geq \Gamma  \label{eq:artificial noise constraint},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Gamma =\frac{P_0\left(|\bar{\mathbf{g}}_0^H\mathbf{h}_0|^2 + \|\mathbf{R}_0^{-1/2}\mathbf{h}_0\|_2^2\right)}{\|\mathbf{h}_0\|_2^2\gamma}$ denotes the  minimum total  interference needs to be generated by the helpers to the eavesdropper. 

We consider the secrecy-rate constrained (SRC) problem, with the goal of minimizing the transmit power of the helpers while guaranteeing the worst-case secrecy rate. The SRC problem is then formulated as the following problem.
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} \label{eq:problem1}
& \underset{\{\mathbf{Q}_i \succeq \mathbf{0}\}}{\text{minimize}}
& & \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i) \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i) \leq P_i, \forall i = 1, \ldots, N\\
&&& \mathbf{h}_i^H \mathbf{Q}_i \mathbf{h}_i= 0, \forall i = 1,\ldots,N\\
&&& \min_{\{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i \in \mathcal{G}_i\}}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\mathbf{Q}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i) \geq  \Gamma,\\
&&& \forall i = 1, \ldots, N.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Constraint~\eqref{eq:sum_noise} can be decomposed into $N+1$ constraints by introducing the new variables $\tau_i, i =1,\ldots,N$, the physical meaning of which are the minimum interferences that the $N$ helpers need to generate to Eve, respectively. The decomposed constraints follow as:
\begin{eqnarray}
&\underset{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i \in \mathcal{G}_i }\min(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\mathbf{Q}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i) \geq  \tau_i, \forall i = 1,\ldots,N\label{eq:artificial noise constraint decomposed}\\
&\sum_{i =1}^{N}\tau_i \geq \Gamma.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
Then problem \eqref{eq:problem1} can be transformed to the following problem
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned} \label{eq:problem2}
& \underset{\{\mathbf{Q}_i \succeq \mathbf{0}\},\{\tau_i \geq 0\}}{\text{minimize}}
& & \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i) \\
& \text{subject to}
& & \mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i) \leq P_i, \forall i = 1, \ldots, N\\
&&& \mathbf{h}_i^H \mathbf{Q}_i \mathbf{h}_i= 0, \forall i = 1,\ldots,N\\
&&& \min_{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i \in \mathcal{G}_i}(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\mathbf{Q}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i) \geq  \tau_i,\\
&&&\forall i = 1,\ldots,N\\
&&&\sum_{i =1}^{N}\tau_i \geq \Gamma.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

%The implication of \eqref{eq:artificial noise constraint decomposed} is
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i^H\mathbf{R}_i\tilde{\mathbf{g}} _i - 1\leq 0  \Rightarrow (\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\mathbf{Q}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i) - \tau_i \geq 0.
%\end{eqnarray}
According to the $\mathcal{S}$-Procedure \cite{ConvexOpt_Boyd}, constraint \eqref{eq:artificial noise constraint decomposed}  in the linear matrix inequality (LMI) form is
\begin{eqnarray}
\left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
	\lambda_i\mathbf{R}_i+\mathbf{Q}_i  & \mathbf{Q}_i\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i \\
	\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i^H\mathbf{Q}_i& \bar{\mathbf{g}}_i^H\mathbf{Q}_i\bar{\mathbf{g}} _i- \tau_i -\lambda_i\\
	\end{array} } \right] \succeq \mathbf{0},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\lambda_i \geq 0$ is a new optimization variable introduced by the $\mathcal{S}$-procedure. Then Problem \eqref{eq:problem2} can be solved using convex optimization tools such as CVX\cite{cvx}.

%So problem \eqref{eq:problem2} can be transformed to the following problem
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{aligned} \label{eq:problem3}
%& \underset{\{\mathbf{Q}_i\},\{\lambda_i\},\{\tau_i\}}{\text{maximize}}
%& & \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i) \\
%& \text{subject to}
%& & \mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i) \leq P_i, \forall i = 1, \ldots, N\\
%&&& \mathbf{h}_i^H \mathbf{Q}_i \mathbf{h}_i= 0, \forall i = 1,\ldots,N\\
%&&& \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
%	\lambda_i\mathbf{R}_i+\mathbf{Q}_i  & \mathbf{Q}_i\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i \\
%	\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i^H\mathbf{Q}_i & \bar{\mathbf{g}}_i^H\mathbf{Q}_i\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i - \tau_i -\lambda_i
%	\end{array} } \right] \succeq \mathbf{0},\\
%&&& \forall i = 1, \ldots, N\\
%&&&\sum_{i =1}^{N}\tau_i \geq \Gamma.
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%
%Problem \eqref{eq:problem2} and \eqref{eq:problem3} are equivalent. By solving problem \eqref{eq:problem3} using convex optimization tools such as CVX\cite{cvx}, we can solve the secure communication problem.

%Based on the solved covariance matrices,  $M$ dimensional noise $\mathbf{x}_i$ can be generated and sent out by Jammer-$i$. The transmitted signal of Jammer-$i$ is 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\mathbf{x}_i = \mathbf{Q}_i^{1/2}\mathbf{r}_i.
%\end{eqnarray} 
%$\mathbf{r}_i = [r_{i1},\ldots,r_{iM}]^T$ is Gaussian noise such that $\mathbf{r}_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I})$, where $[\cdot]^T$ means transpose operation, and $\mathbf{I}$ is an $M \times M$ identity matrix. 
%The block diagram of the transmitter of Jammer-$i$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:transmitter}, where the random noise generators generate independent noise waveforms.

\section{Distributed algorithm} \label{sec:distributed algorithm}
Solving problem \eqref{eq:problem2} requires a central unit to collect all the CSI and calculate the covariance matrices of all the helpers. When the number of helpers increases, the centralized algorithm does not scale well. 
In this section, we analyze the structure of the problem and propose a distributed algorithm. 

\emph{Proposition 1:} $\{\tau_i^*\}, \{\mathbf{Q}_i^*\}, i = 1, \ldots, N$ are the optimal solutions of problem \eqref{eq:problem2}. If $\tau_k^* > 0$ and
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\tau_j^*}{\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_j^*)} > \frac{\tau_k^*}{\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_k^*)} \label{eq:efficiency},
\end{eqnarray}
then $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_j^*) = P_j$.

\emph{Proof:} Assuming $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_j^*) < P_j$, we construct $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_j = (1 + \delta) \mathbf{Q}_j^*$ such that $\mathrm{Tr}(\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_j) = P_j$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_k = \frac{\tau_k^* - \delta\tau_j^*}{\tau_k^*} \mathbf{Q}_k^*$. We have
\begin{eqnarray}
\min_{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_j \in \mathcal{G}_j}(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_j+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_j)^H\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_j(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_j+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_j)\geq (1+ \delta)\tau_j^*,\nonumber\\
\min_{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_k \in \mathcal{G}_k}(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_k+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_k)^H\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_k(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_k+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_k) \geq \tau_k^* - \delta\tau_j^*. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
%The same amount interference generated by Jammer-$k$ and Jammer-$j$ to Eve can be guaranteed
%\begin{eqnarray}
%&&(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_j+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_j)^H\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_j(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_j+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_j) \nonumber+ (\bar{\mathbf{g}}_k+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_k)^H\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_k(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_k+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_k)\nonumber\\
%&\geq&  \tau_k^* + \tau_j^*.
%\end{eqnarray}
It is obvious that $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_k, \tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_j$ and other $\mathbf{Q}_i^*, i \neq k,j$ satisfy all the constraints of problem \eqref{eq:problem2}. But
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\mathrm{Tr}(\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_k) + \mathrm{Tr}(\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_j) \nonumber\\
%&=&\frac{\tau_k^* - \delta\tau_j^*}{\tau_k^*} \mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_k^*)  + (1 + \delta)\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_j^*)\\
&=&\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_k^*) + \mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_j^*) + \frac{\delta\tau_k^*\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_j^*)-\delta\tau_j^*\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_k^*)}{\tau_k^*} \nonumber\\
&<&\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_k^*) + \mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_j^*), \label{eq:contradiction}
\end{eqnarray}
where \eqref{eq:contradiction} comes from  \eqref{eq:efficiency}.
Inequality \eqref{eq:contradiction} means $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_k, \tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_j$ and other $\mathbf{Q}_i^*, i \neq k,j$ are the better solutions of problem \eqref{eq:problem2}, which is a contradiction. \hfill$\blacksquare$

The term $\frac{\tau_i^*}{\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i^*)}$ defines the interference generated per unit power by Helper-$i$. We call it the transmit efficiency of Helper-$i$. Proposition 1 shows the fact that in order to generate interference to the eavesdropper in the most efficient way, the helpers with higher transmit efficiency should transmit artificial noise as much as possible.

\emph{Proposition 2:} $\{\tau_i^*\}, \{\mathbf{Q}_i^*\}, i = 1, \ldots, N$ are the optimal solutions of problem \eqref{eq:problem2}. For any $ \tau'_i > 0$ such that problem \eqref{eq:same_efficiency} is feasible, $ \mathbf{Q}'_i$ is the optimal solution of problem \eqref{eq:same_efficiency}. If $\tau_i^* > 0$, $\frac{\tau_i^*}{\text{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i^*)} = \frac{\tau'_i}{\text{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}'_i)}$.
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:same_efficiency}
\begin{aligned} 
& \underset{\mathbf{Q}_i \succeq \mathbf{0}}{\text{minimize}}
& & \text{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i)\\
& \text{subject to}
& & \min_{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i \in \mathcal{G}_i}(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\mathbf{Q}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i) \geq \tau'_i,\\
&&& \text{Tr}\left(\mathbf{Q}_i\right) \leq P_i,\\ 
&&&\text{Tr}\left(\mathbf{h}_i^H\mathbf{Q}_i\mathbf{h}_i\right) = 0.
\end{aligned}
\end{eqnarray}

\emph{Proof:} If $\frac{\tau_i^*}{\text{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i^*)} > \frac{\tau'_i}{\text{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}'_i)}$, let $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_i = \delta\mathbf{Q}_i^ *$ such that $\delta\tau_i^* = \tau'_i$. We have
\begin{equation}
\text{Tr}(\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_i) < \text{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}'_i), \nonumber
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\min_{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i \in \mathcal{G}_i}(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i) \geq \delta\tau_i^* = \tau'_i. \nonumber
\end{equation}
Then $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_i$ satisfies all the constraints of problem \eqref{eq:same_efficiency}. $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_i$  is a better solution of problem \eqref{eq:same_efficiency} , which is a contradiction.

If $\frac{\tau_i^*}{\text{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i^*)} < \frac{\tau'_i}{\text{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}'_i)}$, we let $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_i = \delta\mathbf{Q}'_i$ such that $\delta\tau'_i = \tau_i^*$. We get
\begin{equation}
\text{Tr}(\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_i) < \text{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}^*_i),\nonumber
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation}
\min_{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i \in \mathcal{G}_i}(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i)^H\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_i(\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i+\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i) \geq \delta\tau'_i = \tau_i^*. \nonumber
\end{equation}
So,  $\tilde{\mathbf{Q}}_i$ and other $\mathbf{Q}_k^*, k \neq i$ are better solutions of problem \eqref{eq:problem2}, which is a contradiction.\hfill$\blacksquare$

Proposition 2 describes the fact that the transmit efficiencies of problem \eqref{eq:problem2} can be obtained by solving problem \eqref{eq:same_efficiency} by each helper individually.

%Proposition 2 can be interpreted using Fig.~\ref{fig:interpretation of subproblems}. Ellipsoid B represents the uncertainty of the eavesdropper's channel. When $\mathbf{g}_i$ is in ellipsoid A, we have $\mathbf{g}_i^H\mathbf{Q}_i\mathbf{g}_i \leq  \tau_{i}$. We want to find the ``biggest" ellipsoid A constrained by the power constraint and ZF constraint, such that ellipsoid B is completely outside of the ellipsoid A. Here the ``biggest" ellipsoid corresponds to the $\mathbf{Q}_i$ which has the smallest sum of eigenvalues.  From the figure, we can tell that the shape of ellipsoid A is unchanged, but $\mathbf{Q}_i$ scales with $\tau_i$.
%\begin{figure}[ht]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=8.8cm]{subproblem.pdf} % requires the graphicx package
%	\caption{Interpretation of problem \eqref{eq:subproblem1}}
%	\label{fig:interpretation of subproblems}
%\end{figure}
%Considering the case where  ellipsoid B is enlarged such that it includes the origin, then we cannot find $\mathbf{Q}_i$ to exclude ellipsoid B outside ellipsoid A when $\tau_i$ is positive. That means, if  $\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i^H\mathbf{R}_i\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i \leq 1, \forall i = 1, \ldots,N$, positive interference generated to the eavesdropper cannot be guaranteed, and positive secrecy rate cannot be guaranteed no matter how large the transmit power of the helpers have.   


%Proposition 2 describes the fact that no matter how much interference is needed to be transmitted by each helper, the transmit efficiency remains the same. 

\emph{Proposition 3:} If problem \eqref{eq:same_efficiency} is feasible, there is a rank one solution $\mathbf{Q}_i^*$.

\emph{Proof :} Based on the $\mathcal{S}$-Procedure, problem \eqref{eq:same_efficiency} is equivalent to 
\begin{align} 
& \underset{\mathbf{Q}_i \succeq \mathbf{0}, \lambda_i \geq 0}{\text{minimize}}
& & \text{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i)\nonumber\\ 
& \text{subject to}
& & \mathbf{A} \succeq \mathbf{0},\label{eq:interference_budget}\\
&&& \text{Tr}\left(\mathbf{Q}_i\right) \leq P_i,\label{eq:power}\\ 
&&&\text{Tr}\left(\mathbf{h}_i^H\mathbf{Q}_i\mathbf{h}_i\right) \leq 0 \label{eq:ZF_constraint}.
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A} = \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
	\lambda_i\mathbf{R}_i+\mathbf{Q}_i  & \mathbf{Q}_i\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i \\
	\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i^H\mathbf{Q}_i& \bar{\mathbf{g}}_i^H\mathbf{Q}_i\bar{\mathbf{g}} _i- \tau'_i -\lambda_i\\
	\end{array} } \right]. \nonumber
\end{equation}
Let
\begin{equation}\nonumber
\mathbf{A}_1 = \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
	\lambda_i\mathbf{R}_i  &\mathbf{0} \\
	\mathbf{0} & - \tau_i -\lambda_i,\\
	\end{array} } \right],\\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{F} = \left[\mathbf{I}_M  ~\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i\right]. \nonumber
\end{equation}
Matrix $\mathbf{A}$ can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{\mathbf{A}_1} + \mathbf{F}^H\mathbf{Q}_i\mathbf{F}. \label{eq:decompose_A}
\end{equation}

The KKT conditions related to $\mathbf{Q}_i$ are 
\begin{eqnarray}
	\mathbf{\Psi}=\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{F}\mathbf{\Phi}\mathbf{F}^H + \mu\mathbf{I} + \nu\mathbf{h}_i\mathbf{h}_i^H\label{eq:rank_n-1},\\
	\mathbf{Q}_i\mathbf{\Psi} = \mathbf{0} \label{eq:nullity},\\
	\mathbf{A}\mathbf{\Phi} = \mathbf{0} \label{eq:kkt_interferece},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathbf{\Phi} \succeq \mathbf{0},\mu \geq 0,\nu \geq 0,\mathbf{\Psi} \succeq \mathbf{0}$ are the dual variables associated with constraints \eqref{eq:interference_budget}, \eqref{eq:power}, \eqref{eq:ZF_constraint}, and $\mathbf{Q}_i \succeq \mathbf{0}$ respectively.
Substituting \eqref{eq:decompose_A} into \eqref{eq:kkt_interferece}, we obtain
\begin{equation} \label{eq:FF}
\mathbf{A}_1\mathbf{\Phi} + \mathbf{F}^H\mathbf{Q}_i\mathbf{F}\mathbf{\Phi} = \mathbf{0}.
\end{equation}
Pre-multiplying \eqref{eq:FF} by $[\mathbf{I}_{M}~\mathbf{0}]$ and post-multiplying \eqref{eq:FF} by $\mathbf{F}^H$, we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
&&[\mathbf{I}_{M}~\mathbf{0}]\mathbf{A}_1\mathbf{\Phi}\mathbf{F}^H + [\mathbf{I}_{M}~\mathbf{0}]\mathbf{F}^H\mathbf{Q}_i\mathbf{F}\mathbf{\Phi}\mathbf{F}^H = \mathbf{0}. \label{eq:rank1}
\end{eqnarray}
Based on the facts:
\begin{eqnarray}
[\mathbf{I}_{M}~\mathbf{0}]\mathbf{A}_1 = \lambda_i[\mathbf{R}_i ~\mathbf{0}] =\lambda_i\mathbf{R}_i\left(\mathbf{F} - [\mathbf{0}~\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i ]\right),\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
[\mathbf{I}_{M}~\mathbf{0}]\mathbf{F}^H = \mathbf{I}_M \nonumber,
\end{eqnarray}
from \eqref{eq:rank1} we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
\left(\lambda_i\mathbf{R}_i + \mathbf{Q}_i\right)\mathbf{F}\mathbf{\Phi}\mathbf{F}^H = \lambda_i \mathbf{R}_i[\mathbf{0}~\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i ]\mathbf{\Phi}\mathbf{F}^H.
\end{eqnarray}
Then along the the arguments in \cite{li_optimal_2011}, we obtain 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rank11}
\text{rank}\left(\mathbf{F}\mathbf{\Phi}\mathbf{F}^H\right)=1.
\end{equation}

Equation \eqref{eq:nullity} implies that columns of $\mathbf{Q}_i$ must lie in the nullspace of $\mathbf{\Psi}$. Therefore
\begin{eqnarray} 
\text{rank}\left(\mathbf{Q}_i\right) \leq \text{Nullity}\left(\mathbf{\Psi}\right) \leq N - \text{rank}\left(\mathbf{\Psi}\right) \label{eq:KKT_rank}.
\end{eqnarray}
From \eqref{eq:rank_n-1}, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{rank}\left(\mathbf{\Psi}\right) = \text{rank}\left((1 + \mu)\mathbf{I} + \nu\mathbf{h}_i\mathbf{h}_i^H - \mathbf{F}\mathbf{\Phi}\mathbf{F}^H\right). 
\end{eqnarray}
Based on the fact $(1 + \mu)\mathbf{I} + \nu\mathbf{h}_i\mathbf{h}_i^H \succ \mathbf{0}$ and \eqref{eq:rank11},  
$\text{rank}\left((1 + \mu)\mathbf{I} + \nu\mathbf{h}_i\mathbf{h}_i^H- \mathbf{F}\mathbf{\Phi}\mathbf{F}^H\right) \geq N - 1$ due to the matrix structure. Then we obtain $\text{rank}\left(\mathbf{\Psi}\right) \geq N - 1$. The rank of $\mathbf{Q}_i$ cannot be 0, otherwise there will be no interference generated to the eavesdropper. Then from \eqref{eq:KKT_rank}, we get $\text{rank}\left(\mathbf{Q}_i\right) = 1$.\hfill$\blacksquare$

%Let $\bar{\mathbf{p}}_i = \mathbf{P}_{\perp}\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i$, $\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i = \mathbf{P}_{\perp}\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i$, $\mathcal{P}_i = \{\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i:\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^H\mathbf{P}_{\perp}\mathbf{R}_i\mathbf{P}_{\perp}\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i \leq 1 \}$. From Proposition 3, problem \eqref{eq:same_efficiency} can be simplified as the following problem
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\begin{aligned}  \label{eq:same_efficiency_vector}
%& \underset{\mathbf{w}_i}{\text{minimize}}
%& & \|\mathbf{w}_i\|^2\\
%& \text{subject to}
%& & \min_{\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_i \in \mathcal{G}_i}\|(\bar{\mathbf{p}}+\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i)^H\mathbf{w}_i\|^2 \geq \tau'_i, \label{eq:interference_budget}\\
%&&& \|\mathbf{w}_i\|_2^2 \leq P_i.\label{eq:power}\\ 
%\end{aligned}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $\mathbf{w}_i\mathbf{w}_i^H = \mathbf{X}_i$; $\|\cdot\|$ denotes euclidean norm.
%
%\emph{Lemma 1:} The solution $\mathbf{w}_i^*$ must have the following form 
%\begin{equation}
%\mathbf{w}_i^* = \alpha (\bar{\mathbf{p}}
%_i+\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^*)
%\end{equation}
%where $\alpha > 0$; $\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^*$ is the worst-case vector such that $\|(\bar{\mathbf{p}}+\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^*)\mathbf{w}_i^*\|^2 \geq \tau'_i$
%
%\emph{Proof ；} Assuming $\mathbf{w}_i^* \neq \alpha (\bar{\mathbf{p}}
%_i+\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^*), \forall \alpha > 0$. We construct a vector $\mathbf{w}'_i = \alpha (\bar{\mathbf{p}}
%_i+\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^*)$, such that $\|\mathbf{w}_i^*\| =\|\mathbf{w}'_i\|$ According to Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\|(\bar{\mathbf{p}}
%_i+\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^*)\mathbf{w}_i^*\|^2 < \|(\bar{\mathbf{p}}
%_i+\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^*)\|^2\\mathbf{w}_i^*\|^2 \leq \|(\bar{\mathbf{p}}
%_i+\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i^*)\|^2\|\mathbf{w}'_i\|^2
%\end{eqnarray}
%Let $\delta \in (0,1)$, such that $\|(\bar{\mathbf{p}}
%_i+\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_i)\|^2\|\mathbf{w}'_i\|^2 = \tau'_i$. It is obvious that $\delta\mathbf{w}'_i$ is a better solution, which is a contradiction. $\blacksquare$

Based on Proposition 1 and Proposition 2, we propose Algorithm \ref{alg:distributed}.
\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{}\label{alg:distributed}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\item[0.] Set $\tau'_i$ to a small value. 
		\item[1.] Solve \eqref{eq:same_efficiency} for each helper to get $\mathbf{Q}_i$, and calculate the transmit efficiency $\varepsilon_i = \frac{\tau'_i}{\mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{Q}_i)}$.  If \eqref{eq:same_efficiency} is infeasible, set $\varepsilon_i = 0$.
		\item[2.] Broadcast $\varepsilon_i$ and $P_i$ to other helpers. 
		\item[3.] For each helper, set $\mathcal{E} =\{ {\varepsilon_i,\ldots, \varepsilon_N}\}$ and $\mathcal{I} =\{\}$.
		\item[4.] For each helper, find the maximum transmit efficiency in set $\mathcal{E}$. That is $\varepsilon_i = \max~\mathcal{E}$ (if $\mathcal{E}$ is empty,  the maximum transmit efficiency returned is 0). If $\varepsilon_i = 0$, goto step 6; else $\mathcal{I} := \mathcal{I} + \{i\}$; $\mathcal{E} := \mathcal{E}  - \{\varepsilon_i\}$.
		\item[5.] For each helper, if $\Gamma \geq \varepsilon_{i} P_i$, $\mathbf{Q}_{i}^* = \frac{P_i}{\mathrm{Tr(\mathrm{Q}}_i)}\mathbf{Q}_i$, $\Gamma := \Gamma - \varepsilon_iP_i$, goto step 4; else $\mathbf{Q}_{i}^* = \frac{\Gamma}{\tau'_i}\mathbf{Q}_i$, go to step 7.
		\item[6.] The required secrecy rate cannot be guaranteed.
		\item[7.] If $i \in \mathcal{I}$, the transmit covariance of Helper-$i$ is $\mathbf{Q}_i^*$, otherwise the transmit covariance is $\mathbf{0}$.
		
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The basic idea of Algorithm \ref{alg:distributed} is that each helper calculates the transmit efficiency of generating interference to the eavesdropper and the algorithm always chooses the most efficient helper to generate as much interference as possible. In the algorithm, each helper solves a convex optimization problem, which only needs local channel information,  once individually. Then the scalar transmit efficiency and transmit power limit  are broadcast to other helpers. Thus, the network signaling is moderate. After receiving the transmit efficiencies and the transmit power limits of other helpers, the most complex work of each helper is to sort the transmit efficiencies, the complexity of which is $O(N\log(N))$. It should be noted here, in step 5, for the helpers other than Helper-$i$, only $\Gamma$ needs to be updated. So, only transmit efficiency and transmit power limit of each helper need to be shared among the helpers, and the covariance matrix does not need to be sent to other helpers.


\section{Numerical Results} \label{sec:numerical results}
The radio network in Fig.~\ref{fig:system} was simulated. Alice and the helpers have four transmit antennas each. The channel from Alice to Bob is randomly selected and normalized. The channels from the helpers to Bob are randomly generated such that $\|\mathbf{h}_i\| = \alpha,  \forall i = 1,\cdots,N$. The channels from the intended transmitter and the helpers to Eve are randomly generated  such that $\|\bar{\mathbf{g}}_i\| = \beta,\forall i = 0, \cdots,N$. $\alpha,\beta\in  [0.1,10]$ are independent uniformly distributed random variables, which is used to simulate the random distance from the transmitter and the helpers to Bob and Eve. 
Matrices $\mathbf{R}_i$ are randomly generated, and $\|\mathbf{R}_i\|_F = s$. Simulation parameter $s$ determines the eavesdropper's channel uncertainty. The larger $s$ is, the smaller the channel uncertainty is. 
For simplicity, we assume Alice and all the helpers have the same transmit power. That is $P_0=P_i = P$. 
The noise variance of Bob is normalized to 1. We set $\mathrm{SNR}_b = 20 \mathrm{dB}$, which means $P = 100$.

	\label{fig:Changing_Cs}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:Changing_Cs} shows the relationship between the total transmit power and the worst-case achievable secrecy rate. Simulation parameter is set $s = 1$. When there are more helpers, the total transmit power is lower. It is because that there are more strategies for the helpers to choose to generate noise. When the requirement of worst-case secrecy rate is higher, more total transmit power is needed to generate enough noise to confuse the eavesdropper. In the simulation, compared to the transmit power limit of each helper, the actual total transmit power of the helpers is small. It means on average, the helpers only need a small part of the transmit power to generate enough noise to the eavesdropper.

	\label{fig:Changing_s}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:Changing_s} shows  the relationship between the total transmit power and the simulation parameter $s$. In this simulation, we fix the worst-case secrecy rate requirement $R_s \geq 3 $ b/s/Hz. When $s$ is small, which means the uncertainty is large, the helpers need more power to transmit noise to realize the required secure communication. This is because when the uncertainty is greater, the helpers need to transmit more noise to make sure that the performance of the eavesdropper can be degraded enough to guarantee the secrecy rate for all the possible eavesdropper's channels.

\end{figure}

When the channel uncertainty is too great, the helpers may still not be able to generate enough noise to realize required secrecy rate. Fig.~\ref{fig:Cs_success} and Fig.~\ref{fig:s_success} show the relationship of successfully realizing the required secure communication with the worst-case secrecy rate requirement and the eavesdropper's channel uncertainty. For Fig.~\ref{fig:Cs_success}, we fix the simulation parameter $s = 1$. For Fig.~\ref{fig:s_success} we fix the worst-case secrecy rate requirement $R_s \geq 3$ b/s/Hz. It can be shown that higher secrecy rate requirement and larger channel uncertainty will cause less success rate of the required secure communication. But by increasing the number of helpers and using the distributed algorithm proposed in Section \ref{sec:distributed algorithm} which scales well with a large number of helpers, we can increase the success rate of secure communication easily.

Fig.~\ref{fig:comparison} compares the algorithm proposed in this paper with the methods in \cite{huang_cooperative_2011,li_optimal_2011}. When there are no helpers, we solve the SRC problem in \cite{li_optimal_2011} and get the beamformer of the transmitter. When there is one helper, the helper generates interference with full transmit power using ZF jamming \cite{huang_robust_2012}. In \cite{huang_robust_2012}, given the covariance of the noise generated by the helper, the problem of maximizing the worst-case secrecy rate is then solved. For the convenience of comparison, we instead solve the SRC problem given the worst-case interference generated by the helper to the eavesdropper using the method in \cite{li_optimal_2011}. It is shown that if the uncertainty of the eavesdropper is too great, more helpers can improve the secure communication effectively. For example, when $s = 1$ and there are no helpers, the probability of satisfying the required secrecy rate is almost zero. For the scenario where there are $4$ helpers, the worst-case secrecy rate can be met with higher possibility.

\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
This paper discusses a method to implement QoS based secure communication. The channels from the intended transmitter and the helpers to the legitimate receiver are known. But the channels to the eavesdropper are imperfectly known. The intended transmitter uses MRT to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the legitimate receiver. The helpers transmit noise to degrade the performance of the eavesdropper to guarantee the worst-case secrecy rate. The structure of the transmitted noise is exploited and the transmit strategies of the helpers are formulated as a robust convex optimization problem, in which the transmit covariance matrices are the optimization variables. Based on the solved transmit covariance matrices of the helpers, the required secure communication can be implemented. In order to ease the implementation of secure communication, a distributed algorithm, which scales well with a large number of helpers, is proposed. Simulation results show that with the aid of the helpers, robust secure communication can be realized.
